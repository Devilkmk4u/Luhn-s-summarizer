The code examples in this book are written in Python, and familiarity with Python programming will help, but I provide explanations of all the algorithms so that pro-grammers of other languages can follow. The Python code will be particularly easy to
follow for those who know high-level languages like Ruby or Perl. This book is not intended as a guide for learning programming, so it’s important that you’ve done enough coding to be familiar with the basic concepts. If you have a good understanding of recursion and some basic functional programming, you’ll find the material even easier. This book does not assume you have any prior knowledge of data analysis, machine learning, or statistics. I’ve tried to explain mathematical concepts in as simple a manner as possible, but having some knowledge of trigonometry and basic statistics will be help you understand the algorithms.
